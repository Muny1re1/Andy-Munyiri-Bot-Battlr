## Author
This programme is written by Andy Munyiri.

# Project description
This project contains solution that;
   1. Fetch data from db.json endpoints.
   2. Manipulate data to render different components.
   3. Delete data from db.json as well as the front end.


## Programme Setup
The general project has three components. The bat-battlr folder, LICENSE and the readme file. The bat-battlr is the main project and has an src folder with components containing the solutions along with other folders as well. The bot-battlr folder is a react up and depends on data from a db.json file, hence json-server --watch function must be called before inspection of the app.
